# Chart.HeatMap.js (No longer being maintained!)

HeatMap library and plug-in for Chart.js. **This library is no longer being maintained**. 

Thank you to anyone who has expressed interest in this project. It was an early attempt by myself to create a javascript library, but life happened (as it has a tendency to do) immediately after I released this. I have since been far away from the javascript ecosystem (and programming in general), and therefore I no longer (10/9/2019) even have the qualifications to evaluate pull requests. Perhaps one day...

Thank you to all who attempted to contribute to this project, and sorry for not being able to integrate your pull requests.

### Github

The built distributions are also available in the dst folder in 
the source repository at [Github](https://github.com/tmroyal/Chart.HeatMap).

Ensure that you use the file from the dst directory.

For the standalone version, which requires no dependencies:

```
<script src="dst/Chart.HeatMap.S.js"></script>
```

For the plug-in, which requires Chart.js

```
<script src="Chart.js"></script>
<script src="dst/Chart.HeatMap.js"></script>
```
